This is the very simple python script I wrote to scrap coinmarketcap pages to find the prices of coins.
The Coin names are listed in one file and the ticker prices are listed in the other.

HOW TO INTERPRET:
Load it into your favourite python 3 IDE (I use thonny) and just start!
You will need BS4 (Beautiful Soup 4) to run this script.
